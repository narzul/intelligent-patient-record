\section{Conclusions}

This report has presented the detailed design process of a hardware device. Whether the device fulfilled its purpose or not, was not entirely the intent of this report, but to document the series of steps to come up with a solution to a problem. The solution involved designing a product (an intelligent patient record prototype) that meets certain criteria and accomplishes certain tasks. \\

The report documented the use of the engineering design process, and what methods were chosen for each step. Brainstorming was used for idea generation, and choosing possible solutions. Different kinds of prototyping methods were described, with a focus on rapid prototyping. Evaluation methods such as thinking-aloud was used in order to give inspiration for a new possible brainstorming session. \\

The project has been very enriching, with regards to how a product is designed and prototyped. With the recent emergence of the popularity of cheap 3D printers, rapid prototyping using fused deposition modelling has been made possible here, where it was before only available in the domain of companies with much more resources than a hackerspace. This made it possible to create an open, high-fidelity prototype for evaluation.
