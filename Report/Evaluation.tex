\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Drop Test}
We did testing on the last iteration of our desgin, where we drop it of a distance of 1 meter 10 times, efter each time we locked for signs that ist was about to crack of fracture.
efter the 10'th drop we started to see cracks in the acrylic, the cracks apired in the cutout section where there is a sharp courner, however it was only on in the fron acrylic. 
This i properly due to the laser cutting, and could be avoid by making a round cut rathere that a sharp cut

\subsubsection{Power Test}
