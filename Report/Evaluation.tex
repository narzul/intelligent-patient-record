\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Drop Test}
We did testing on the last iteration of our desgin, where we drop at a distance of 1 meter 10 times to simulate the fall from a desk, efter each time we locked for signs that ist was about to crack of fracture.
After the 10'th drop we started to see cracks in the acrylic, the cracks apired in the cutout section where there is a sharp courner, however this was only on the front acrylic plade, had we done the drop many more times we prolery whould have seen the same result in the back plate. 
This is properly due to the laser cutting, and could be avoid by making a round cut rathere that a sharp cut, or by drilling a hule to relive tension there might have been build up, during the laser cuting.

We did not check the hardware during the test, after the test we tested the eletronic and found that it hadn't suffered any damage.

\subsubsection{Power Test}
For the power test we borrowed a discharger, from vaidas, where you can set the amount of amps it has to drain.
We calculated that the devise whould drain around 350 milliamps, if it runs at maximum capacity.
From that we found out that it would rund for 4 hours, we later found out that if it is in idle mode, it can run for around 20 hours, but all this depends on the batteri, that we have borrow from getvolt.
