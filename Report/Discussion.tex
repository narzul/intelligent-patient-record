\subsection{Evaluation}

The first three iterations weren't evaluated with the methods described in section \ref{section-evaluation}, as the prototypes weren't deemed to be functional. The evaluation therefore didn't involve any users, because technical issues had to be fixed. However, it can still be argued that the pattern of prototyping, reviewing, and refining took place, as illustrated by the steps in figure \ref{fig:eng-design-process}. Only the fourth prototype was deemed to be worthy of usability-testing with real users. \\

Five separate users were given the prototype shown on figure \ref{fig:journal-1} to hold in their hands, and were asked some questions, in order to perform the thinking-aloud protocol described in section \ref{section-evaluation}. The following is the response gathered from that round of evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Test person A:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
	  		\item Q: What do you think of the design?
	  		\item A: It is not so nice, the box sticks out too much.
	  		\item Q: What do you think about the weight?
			\item A: The weight seems fine to me.
			\item Q: Is it easy to hold?
			\item A: It's easy to hold but, but it would be best if the box would be the same height as the plate.
			\item Q: Any comments?
			\item A: 
		\end{itemize}

	\item Test person B:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
			\item Q: What do you think of the design?
			\item A: It is very fine, even if there is color difference between the box and the plate.
			\item Q: What do you think about the weight?
			\item A: It is ok.
			\item Q: Is it easy to hold?
			\item A: Yes you can hold it, but it will probably be a bit of a problem if you are left-handed.
			\item Q: Any comments?
			\item A: It would be nice if the box could be slimmer and have the same height as the plate.
		\end{itemize}

	\item Test person C:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
			\item Q: What do you think of the design?
			\item A: The plates are a little thick, and it would be best if you could remove one.
			\item Q: What do you think about the weight?
			\item A: It is too heavy, if you remove one of the plates you could make it lighter.
			\item Q: Is it easy to hold?
			\item A: The box gets a bit in the way, the edges are a bit sharp too.
			\item Q: Any comments?
			\item A: 
		\end{itemize}

	\item Test person D:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
			\item Q: What do you think of the design?
			\item A: I think it's very neat.
			\item Q: What do you think about the weight?
			\item A: I think it's fine.
			\item Q: Is it easy to hold?
			\item A: Yes.
			\item Q: Any comments?
			\item A: Could be slimmer.
		\end{itemize}

	\item Test person E:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
			\item Q: What do you think of the design?
			\item A: It's great, I like the rounded corners.
			\item Q: What do you think about the weight?
			\item A: It fits me.
			\item Q: Is it easy to hold?
			\item A: Yes and no, if I hold it at the left side then yes.
			\item Q: Any comments?
			\item A: It must be made so you can hold it equally comfortably with both hands.

Some recurring comments can be gathered from this think-aloud test, and the improvement suggestions can be summarised:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0em
	\item The electronics compartment should be thinner.
	\item The electronics compartment should be placed out of the way of where the user holds the journal.
\end{itemize}

Although the test revealed the prototype to be quite pleasing, people have very high expectations from electronics, and expect an electronic device to be very thin, as this seems to be the trend with computers and smartphones. \\

The users didn't come with many free comments however -- they should have been asked more questions, such as the readability of the LEDs. Unfortunately, the development had to stop for this project due to time constraints, and a fifth iteration wouldn't have been possible to make. If more time had been at disposal, the thinking-aloud test would have been the conclusion of a first cycle of development. The results from the test would have been a kickstarter for a new brainstorming session about how to solve those issues, and to build a new prototype to be evaluated. \\

The point is to run multiple tests because after the first study with 5 users has found 85\% of the usability problems, a second test will discover whether the fixes worked or whether they didn't. And when introducing a new design, there is the risk of introducing a new usability problem, even if the old one did get fixed. The second test will therefore also serve as quality assurance of the outcome of the first study. The same insight applies to this redesign: not all the fixes will work, and some deeper issues will be uncovered after cleaning up the previous prototype, and a third design cycle is needed. \\

Another usability test that could have been performed, is the use of scenarios. A task scenario is an action that is asked to the participant to take, on the prototype under test. Task scenarios need to provide context, so users engage with the device, and pretend in the case of this project, that they are a doctor or a nurse. Watching people use the prototype, would have been an effective way of understanding the positive and negative aspects of it.
