\section{Design analysis and concept diagrams}

\subsection{Iterations}
we have used prototyping in order to get a viable device, through the different designs we have been able to see different problems, which have meant that we had to iterate to a new version, we have been limited by time, so we have had to make some compromises.

Going from Steven's design to our first prototype, we had to re think on how it was put togethere 
In the first prototype, we tryed to make it smaller and embed the hardware and record into the, and remove the docking for the tablet
The tablet should then be plased on top of the device, inorder to detect the patient record.


The first iteration that we build did have some problems.
The first is that it is expensive to build, since we are using a lot of acrylic, the second point is that it still is heavy, and unwieldy.
But i did give some ideas for the next iteration.
