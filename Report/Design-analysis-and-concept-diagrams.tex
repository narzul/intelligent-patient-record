\section{Design analysis and concept diagrams}

\subsection{Iterations}
for devolpying the prototypes we have used different software, to make the design files.
we have used prototyping in order to get a viable device, through the different designs we have been able to see different problems, which have meant that we had to iterate to a new version, we have been limited by time, so we have had to make some compromises.

\subsubsection{fisrt}
The first iteration that we build did have some problems.
The first is that it is expensive to build, since we are using a lot of acrylic, the second point is that it still is heavy, and unwieldy.
But i did give some ideas for the next iteration.
